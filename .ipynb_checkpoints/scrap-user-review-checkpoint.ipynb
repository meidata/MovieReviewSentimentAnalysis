      "['\\n\\nThis top-notch police story rises far above the norm for its type. A true\\nexample of ensemble acting, the film incorporates many well-known character\\nactors all putting in first-rate work, led by the superb efforts of Kirk\\nDouglas and William Bendix, the latter in what may be his best screen role.\\nThis may be one of the earliest examples of the \"typical day\" genre, in\\nwhich multiple story lines occurring in a single day in a certain locale are\\nmelded into a whole (a genre exemplified by the \"Hill Street Blues\" and\\n\"Barney Miller\" of tv). An excellent script and good direction, aided by\\ninteresting characters, keep the dramatic tension moving along briskly to\\nthe searing conclusion. This is not your run-of-the-mill police story, and\\nis definitely worth a see.   \\n', '\\nIn one day in the 21st Precinct of New York, many criminals are booked\\nafter being arrested: a shoplifter is brought after stealing a purse in\\na department store; two burglars with extensive criminal record are\\ncaptured by a policeman burgling an apartment; the small time embezzler\\nArthur Kindred (Craig Hill), who is primary, is arrested without any\\nresistance. The tough Detective McLeod (Kirk Douglas), who loves his\\nwife Mary (Eleanor Parker), is an honest detective with strong\\nprinciples and code of honor and zero tolerance. He is near to conclude\\na case against an abortionist, Dr. Karl Schneider (George Macready),\\nwith the testimony of a witness that is coming to identify Dr.\\nSchneider in the precinct. However, the woman is bribed and the upset\\nMcLeod hits Schneider, and he insinuates to McLeod\\'s chief, Lt.\\nMonaghan (Horace McMahon), that the problem is personal and gives the\\nname of Mary McLeod. Lt. Monaghan invites Mary to come to his office\\nfor investigation, when deep innermost secrets of her past are\\ndisclosed leading to a tragedy.\"Detective Story\" is amazingly intense and full of emotions in spite of\\nbeing shot practically in only one scenario in the interior of the\\nprecinct. Kirk Douglas gives an outstanding performance, developing a\\ncomplex character that sees his principles destroyed in a couple of\\nhours with a great intensity. Eleanor Parker is also fantastic, in the\\ndramatic and heartbreaking role of Mary McLeod. The direction of\\nWilliam Wyler is perfect as usual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Chaga de Fogo\" (\"Sore of Fire\")\\n', '\\nAdapted from a Broadway play, \"Detective Story\" is in the Grand Hotel\\ngenre; two of the New York actors here made their film debuts\\x97Joseph\\nWiseman, as the insane, homicidal burglar, and Lee Grant, as the gay\\nand spirited Brooklynese shoplifter\\x85 \"Detective Story\" is not so much a tale of detection but a focusing on\\nthe life and character of just one detective, James McLeod (Kirk\\nDouglas).McLeod is no ordinary detective, he is a fanatic, dedicated to the law\\nand excessively brutal in dealing with criminals\\x85 He is particularly\\nupset about abortionists, and it gradually becomes apparent that this\\nis a psychological block in his mind\\x85 Some tragic happening in his past\\nhas caused him to look upon abortionists in a pathological light, and\\nthe abortionist in this film, played by George Macready with his patent\\nbrand of quiet, sinister refinement, has a hard time in the hands of\\nMcLeod\\x85 The abortion angle of the original play was taken to the screen, partly\\nbecause of censorship, and partly because the close-up, immediacy of\\nthe camera requires rage to be clearly more explained than on the\\nstage\\x85 Therefore, the film abortionist is also the manipulator of an adoption\\nring and a farm for unwed mothers\\x85 Whenever he appears at the precinct\\nthe abortionist is accompanied by his lawyer, although he might also\\nhave hired a bodyguard, since the fist-swinging McLeod is not above\\nencircling his suspects\\x85 As the story progresses, the reasons for McLeod\\'s vicious temper and\\nhis hatred for crime are revealed as deriving from his love-hate\\nattitude toward his father, a man of crooked tendencies\\x85 His mania\\nmakes life hard for his gentle wife Mary (Eleanor Parker) to whom he is\\nnevertheless greatly attached\\x85 Detective McLeod is understandably shattered when he discovers that his\\nwife was once herself the subject of an abortion, and that the man who\\nperformed the illegal operation was the abortionist now at his mercy,\\nKarl Schneider (George Macready).\"Detective Story\" is light on plot line but rich in its different cast\\nof characters\\x85 It is, in fact, a series of character studies, one major\\nand many minor\\x85 Kirk Douglas carries the burden of McLeod and makes the tormented\\npoliceman painfully believable\\x97it is almost a nonstop, swirling\\nperformance\\x85 Around him Wyler arranges an expert team of actors:\\nWilliam Bendix as a tough but warm-hearted veteran cop; Horace McMahon\\nas the precinct lieutenant who tolerates the frenzy of McLeod because\\nhe realizes he is doing his job honest1y and well; Eleanor Parker as\\nthe wife, driven to near-distraction by her husband; and several\\nweirdly amusing criminal types, of whom those played by Wiseman and Lee\\nGrant are shining examples, all of them moving through the dirty,\\noppressive atmosphere of a police station on any given work day\\x85\\n', \"\\n\\nSome films are so full of life they have to be seen again and again. I first\\nsaw this one in my early teens and loved it, despite difficulty in\\nunderstanding it. Decades later I still love it, and always will. It has its\\nflaws: everybody overacts (beautifully), as if on stage. The writing is a\\nbit too well-structured, almost like clockwork, the characters are a bit too\\nsymbolic and easy to categorise. The comic relief kicks in just on schedule.\\nThe psychological diagnosis is too precise. And yet, this is one of the\\ngreatest films ever made. It has a sense of respect for the totality of\\nlife, and makes tragedy almost poetic. Fascinating though the plot may be,\\nthe essence of this film goes beyond plot. It's a symphony of cacophony. The\\nplaywright would have made a fine composer. \\n\", '\\n\\nWilliam Wyler, who won three Oscars for Best Director (\"Mrs. Miniver\", \"The\\nBest Years of Our Lives\", \"Ben-Hur\"), and been nominated a record 12 times\\nbetween 1937 and 1966, is not often thought of as one of our \"great\"\\ndirectors.  Truly, he was.  Here, with the filmization of Sidney Kingsley\\'s\\nstage play about a NYC police station, focusing on the amazingly bad day\\nwhich has been happening to Detective Kirk Douglas, Wyler shows his skill\\nand diversity.Kirk Douglas is the vision of a crumbling spirit disguised by toughness and\\nauthority.  He towers over a stellar cast, including Eleanor Parker as his\\nwife, William Bendix as one of the other officers in the precinct, and Lee\\nGrant as an inexperienced shoplifter.  The one actor who truly stands out\\nfrom the rest is Joseph Wiseman, who is simply a spark plug made up as an\\nactor, giving an astounding recreation of his stage role as an on-edge,\\ncheap suit-wearing thief.  He displays the physical dexterity of James\\nCagney in the physique of a beanstalk, and proves to be more dangerous than\\nany other movie crook we\\'d seen in the past.In one of the great Oscar follies of our time (and there were many), the\\n1952 voters neglected to nominate Douglas as Best Actor, or Wiseman in a\\nsupporting slot.  Nominations were given out for Wyler\\'s direction, the\\nscreenplay, and for Parker and Grant, lead and supporting actresses\\nrespectively.  None for Best Picture, the other nominations were passed over\\nin favor of \"A Place in the Sun\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".  And who\\nwas picked for Best Picture?  Well, staying true to AMPAS\\'s mission of\\npicking only the most harmless movie of the year (\"Driving Miss Daisy\",\\n\"Chariots of Fire\", \"Shakespeare in Love\"), instead of the best, they picked\\n\"An American in Paris\", which will be remembered by film historians as\\nmerely a rehearsal for \"Singin\\' in the Rain\".  Oh, well.\\n', \"\\nAn assortment of detectives and an assortment of criminals, all\\ngathered together under the oppressive 21st Precint roof. It's a day\\nthat nobody present will ever forget, for better or worse...Directed by William Wyler (Best years Of Our Lives, Ben-Hur & Wuthering\\nHeights) and starring Kirk Douglas, Eleanor Parker, William Bendix,\\nCathy O'Donnell and Joseph Wiseman.Detective Story is based on the smash hit Broadway play by Sidney\\nKingsley, adapted by Phillip Yordan and Robert Wyler, it's with much\\nrelief to me that the worry of it being a stagy production never\\nactually materialises. Practically set on one bleak, but quite\\nexcellently appropriate set (creation courtesy of Hal Pereira & Earl\\nHedrick), Detective Story manages to rise above its very simple plot by\\nboasting interesting characters in a pot boiling story just waiting to\\npeak. Each character has much to offer the film, be it oddly quirky or\\novertly intense, within the confines of this particular precinct, the\\ncharacters create engrossing drama.It's a difficult film to sell without giving too much away, by\\noutlaying the character persona's and mental fortitude's, I personally\\nfeel that it will dull the impact of this influential crime genre\\npiece. It's got real raw emotive acting, particularly from Kirk Douglas\\nas Jim McLeod and Eleanor Parker as his wife Mary, while the technical\\naspects (watch Lee Garmes' camera glide like a third party witness) are\\nimpressively high. And with it embracing as it does, morality themes,\\nit also doesn't lack for interest to the cranial head scratching crowd.\\nIt's by definition to me an all encompassing picture, one that is now\\nsure to be a perennial viewing in my home. It's not a standard fare\\ncrime picture, and it most definitely is a talky film, but it works\\nincredibly well, so one can only hope that many others will feel the\\nsame as me, namely that it is a fine and essential genre piece. 8/10\\n\", '\\nDetective Story 1951Virtue and abortion don\\'t mix well--more like matter and antimatter\\nthan oil and water-- and in \"Detective Story,\" virtue is as flexible\\nand pretty as a cinder block, and abortion is as covert and murderous\\nas, well, as an abortion at its worst, back when it was an illegal,\\nhorrifying ordeal. In this adapted theater piece, we expect the leading\\nplayers to be scarred, or dead, and they are, though tender love does\\nblossom and save one young couple. \"Detective Story,\" it turns out,\\ngoes way beyond being a detective story.Virtue? Kirk Douglas has more than a man can handle. At first this\\nseems only to make him a terrific detective for a post-War New York\\nPolice Department, but he ends up being mostly terrifying. Yes, he is\\ntireless and experienced and clever. He knows when to be ruthless and\\nwhen to be kind, he has a nose for evil, and he is a good guy with the\\nother detectives. We admire him. But the pieces start to fall askew.\\nWhen he interferes with the kindness of a colleague (played with great\\nsympathy by William Bendix), insisting on prosecuting a young man when\\neven the victim doesn\\'t want to, we see a heartless man, and a reckless\\none, with a damning instinct. And we know he has to either die or see\\nthe light and change. In the end he does both.Abortion? Two decades before the 1970 repeal of abortion laws in New\\nYork State, it\\'s an unsanctioned death, a criminal malpractice, and it\\nis presented as a horrifying personal and social tragedy, a kind of\\nsin. It appears from all angles--the abortion doctor with his canny\\nlawyer, the detective\\'s wife and her boyfriend from the past, the one\\nwho got her pregnant, and eventually the detective, who came after the\\nfact but is the one most harmed by it, thanks to his blind\\nstubbornness. The woman, the detective\\'s wife (played by Eleanor Parker) has buried\\nthe memory, almost, and in the scene where she has to finally tell her\\nhusband about it, the detective\\'s world is too black and white to cope.\\nSuddenly she\\'s a tramp, and does he protest that he was a virgin when\\nhe married her? Hardly. (I\\'m sure he wasn\\'t.) Does it even matter that\\nshe got pregnant with this earlier man (who at one point is in the\\nroom), and that she aborted the child (described as an induced\\nstillbirth)? No, all that matters to Douglas is that she had sex with\\nsomeone before him. Voila! In his eyes she is now mere filth.But she is not filth, and we all know it. She begs him, explains to\\nhim, cries for him, but he doesn\\'t see the virtue in her. She, in turn,\\nsees the blackness in his brain and realizes, in a compact epiphany,\\nthat he will never change. And so when she says she\\'s leaving him\\nforever, he believes her. This final collision between his unbending\\nrules of propriety--in crime and in love equally--with the pliable,\\nreasonable realities around him, is his ruin.This is all messy, deep, troubling stuff. Stir it up at a brisk pace,\\nshoot it using sharp, stark camera-work, and you have a really tight,\\nfirst rate, significant film. It has slipped under the radar as a\\nmasterpiece for several reasons, including, maybe, an excessive\\nperfection that starts to feel slick--an odd trap for a filmmaker to\\nneed to avoid, but one often facing William Wyler, one of the slickest\\nand most stylelessly perfect of directors. The shooting barely leaves\\nthe suite of offices--there is that brief ride in the paddy wagon--but\\nit doesn\\'t need to. Even the beautiful moment in the cab, where Douglas\\nshows his most human side to his very human wife, they remain parked\\nright outside the station. It\\'s not an action film. In fact, it\\'s not\\nreally a crime film, nor a film noir (despite the gloom, and the date\\non it). It\\'s about man\\'s inability to see beyond himself. His obsessive\\nvirtue, with no heart, is a capital offense, because he becomes stupid.\\nHe forgets to dodge the bullet.This is also a movie about a justice higher than law. The detective\\'s\\nwife, who has broken the law, is herself broken by events, but she\\nleaves the movie a free woman, resolved and strong. The abortion doctor\\nis to be booked the next morning, and with luck he\\'ll be jailed.\\nBendix, who shows the highest virtue of anyone in the movie,\\nsurvives--he\\'s the one who says a prayer over the dead detective\\'s\\nbody, dead because Douglas cannot survive the blackness in his brain. A key ongoing sideplot is resolved just after Douglas is shot. Bleeding\\nand in mortal pain, he releases an unlikely first offender who he\\nearlier wanted to prosecute. This feelgood last act is not left to the\\ngood Bendix, but to Douglas, who gets to see the light before the\\nlights go out. The young criminal\\'s real savior in the long run,\\nhowever, is pure true love, and we buy into that more easily,\\nespecially in the form of Cathy O\\'Donnell, who sure knows how to be\\npure and in love, just see \"They Live by Night\" from three years\\nearlier. So when the movie ends we are done with stark, fast\\npenetration and desperation. The precinct is in emotional shambles. But\\na corner has been turned, and in the gorgeous parting shot, we are\\ntaken to the street at night, from above, and the young couple and\\ntheir shadows meld back into the swarm of real world, our world.\\n', '\\nAdapted from a stage play by Sidney Kingsley, \"Detective Story\" depicts\\na day at a New York police precinct in the early 1950\\'s. The film\\nresembles a feature-length episode of \"Barney Miller\" without the jokes\\nas the detectives bring various shoplifters, petty thieves, and\\nembezzlers into the station for booking. However, the film does not\\nlack humor as a broad hammy performance by Joseph Wiseman and an only\\nslightly subtler take on a Brooklynese shoplifter by Lee Grant lighten\\nup the often heavily dramatic proceedings.The central character, Detective Jim McLeod, is an unforgiving,\\nby-the-book veteran, who sees the world in black and white, good versus\\nevil, with no shades of gray in between. Kirk Douglas brings McLeod to\\nlife in one of his finest, most powerful performances. Douglas\\'s\\nOscar-caliber work is matched by a fragile, deeply felt performance by\\nEleanor Parker as McLeod\\'s wife, who harbors a secret from her past\\nthat, unknown to either McLeod or his wife, connects back to an\\non-going police case. The scenes between Douglas and Parker are among\\nthe best in the film.Veteran director William Wyler retains most of the play\\'s action in the\\ncentral precinct room and only occasionally breaks from the\\nclaustrophobic set for a breather. Lee Garmes photographed \"Detective\\nStory\" in crisp black and white, and some of the shots of New York City\\ncould be framed and hung on a wall. With a cast of top character\\nplayers that includes Gladys George, William Bendix, Frank Faylen, and\\nGeorge Macready, the multi-character, multi-plotted \"Detective Story\"\\nis a powerful, well-acted film that somehow is less often seen than its\\nquality warrants.\\n', \"\\nKirk Douglas was in the forefront of a set of movie stars in the post\\nwar period (with Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, James Dean, Burt\\nLancaster, and (a little later) Paul Newman) who had more emotional\\nproblems than initially appeared in their characters. Douglas looked\\ncompetent and able in every part, but sooner or later something would\\nshow his less attractive personality. When he played Midge, the great\\nboxer, in CHAMPION, his selfishness expands and expands as his\\nreputation does. His motivations for joining forces with Burt\\nLancaster's Wyatt Earp in GUNFIGHT AT THE O. K. Corral is based in part\\non a rivalry with John Ireland as Johnny Ringo, a rival of Doc Holiday\\nfor a woman. And his Detective Jim McLeod is a modern day Inspector\\nJavert, ashamed of his father's criminal behavior that drove his mother\\ninsane - and determined to root out all evil, no matter how big or\\nsmall it is.DETECTIVE STORY, a successful play by Sidney Kingsley, has classical\\nunity, as it takes place all in one day - which happens to be the final\\nday of McLeod's life. He is the central detective in the story, and we\\nsee him early enjoying a moment of joy with his wife Mary (Eleanor\\nParker). But once he is in the precinct he is all business, involved in\\nthree cases: the arrest of two burglars responsible for nine\\nburglaries; the arrest of a young man (who is actually clean-cut) for\\nembezzling from his employer, and the completion (after a year) of a\\nserious abortion case against one Karl Scneider (George Macready), a\\nformer doctor now a New Jersey farmer. Schneider has been responsible\\nfor at least one patient's death in the past, and another of his\\npatients is currently in Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. Since\\nSchneider has been lucky so far, McCleod is furious and keeps pushing\\nthe envelope to get him. As it turns out Schneider happens to have\\ninformation on McCleod's household - which his attorney threatens to\\nreveal to the press. The precinct commander (Horace MacMahon) is forced\\nto get to the bottom of this mystery.There is no compassion whatsoever from Douglas to any criminals. He\\nexplains that when he was starting out he arrested two young punks, but\\ntook pity on them and let them go. Three days later, one killed a store\\nowner in a robbery. Douglas says he won't make that mistake again. He\\nnever seems to notice that the other punk was not (apparently) in the\\nrobbery - murder, and presumably could have turned over a new leaf.So he won't give a break to the young embezzler, who stole from his\\nemployer to try to wine and dine an old girlfriend who no longer wants\\nto know him - even though the money can be replaced. McCleod's partner\\nBrody (William Bendix) is more gentle (the young man reminds him of\\nBendix's dead son). But McLeod won't change.Then comes the shocker - Macmahon discovers the secret that Parker and\\nGerald Mohr (Parker's old boyfriend) have concealed - which Macready\\nwould have been equally willing to conceal if Douglas had not\\npersecuted him. It destroys the peace of mind and Douglas's home-life\\nin two shattering moments in the movie.As for the pair of burglars, one of them is a total simpleton, but the\\nbrains of the outfit (Joseph Weismann in a great over-the-top part) is\\nfar more colorful...and more deadly. In fact, Weismann and Douglass are\\nperfectly balanced for the conclusion of the movie: literally they\\nsettle each other's hash with a couple of shots.A first class direction job by William Wyler, and the cast (with good\\nperformances in support by Luis van Rooten, Lee Grant (her first film\\npart), and Gladys George). And a really good, if stagy, conclusion to a\\nfine film.\\n\", \"\\nA play which tells the story of a day in the lives of the several\\npeople who populate a police precinct translates more or less\\ntransparently between mediums, though with its theatrical pace results\\nin a vigorous, enthralling drama with a solid, receptive cast. Kirk\\nDouglas, playing the central cop, a brooding maverick who can't stand\\nhaving to stop at the line between law and vengeance, is very intense\\nin particular, the breadth of view of a crystallizing soul masqueraded\\nby rigor and command, which makes for some delicate scenes with his\\nwife, Eleanor Parker. The very natural William Bendix is one of the\\nother officers in the precinct, a cop with a delicate sensibility, the\\nclear contrast to the uncompromising protagonist. But the film's\\nbrightest highlights are the few moments dominated by the brilliant Lee\\nGrant, whose character seems non-sequitary yet has a refreshing\\noutside-world quality. Dense with lively exhibitions of the sort of\\ndevil-may-care influx that transits and languishes through a workday of\\nplainclothes detectives, it is a police procedural not in the\\ntraditional sense. There is no central case over which our detectives\\ntoil. There is simply an allotment of arrests and conflicting views on\\nthe confines of police work.While this Edgar-winning cop drama stays in effect a filmed play,\\nWilliam Wyler uses the innate limitations of such a project as a\\ncreative outlet, as well as his widely known grating approach multiple\\nretakes. The cooped up setting is not just a space where all manner of\\ncharacters eyeball each other and interplay. It complements the lurking\\ngist of the story's thematic elements and overall to the film's\\ndramatic impact. The staging of the individual scenes, which a lot of\\nthe time plays on foreground-background relationships, is intensified\\nby Lee Garmes's deep-focus cinematography, a consistent device used by\\nWyler throughout his body of work no matter how much he diversifies in\\ngenre and tone.The core of Wyler's consistency throughout his tremendous career is his\\ninsistence on emotional truth, thus his enraging approach to directing\\nactors, and thus his track record with directing Oscar-nominated and\\nOscar-winning performances. Wyler's discretion of angle exposes or\\nintimates more character than the last and apprehends the decisive\\nsensibility to give significance to the experience of seeing the film.\\nHe didn't coin anything new. He didn't use unprecedented angles or\\nlogistically fussy dolly takes. He's discerning from the acknowledged\\nbill of fare of long shot, medium shot and close-up as the atmosphere\\nof the scene calls for.\\n\"]\n"

       " [\"\\nThe last time, I felt like this, in a cinema, I was six years old and I\\nwas watching Star Wars. I never imagined, I would ever find that\\nfeeling again in a cinema. That sense of being transported to another\\nworld. The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back. Not\\neven at the end - which left my head spinning. It is a beautiful film\\nwith soul, wit, charm, style and love. It is simply outrageous! Bold\\nand fantastic and fantastical. I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that.\\nHe's a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse. This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. I\\nwas lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial. It has been five days since I saw La La Land and I am still thinking\\nabout it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul. I\\nmean it gets in there - that music - the music of the firmament. Flying\\nstill, dreaming still... thank you Damien.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWriter/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going\\nfor him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing,\\nand completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not\\ndo the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME\\nremake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children\\nhijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance\\nsequence.From that point on, the film is hypnotic.We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of\\nthe 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected\\nto see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect\\nand totally wonderful.Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance,\\nbut he delivers the goods. Stone, who was supposed to be \"the next big thing\" after Easy A (2010),\\nsteals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The\\nawards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film\\nindustry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they\\nwould film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at\\nthe last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by\\ngiving us an alternate ending, along with the \"real\" ending, along with\\na closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in\\nHollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.Destined to be a classic. Recommended.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for\\na good musical, but I\\'ll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I\\nwas intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a\\nmusical picture to make it fresh and unique. So when I had the chance\\nto see a late-planned viewing at the London Film Festival, I jumped at\\nthe chance (FYI, Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post-\\nfilm Q&A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night\\nbefore so I was chuffed!)The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved\\nto LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and \\'make it\\', while\\nGosling is a jazz purist (\"Anyone who doesn\\'t like jazz just doesn\\'t\\nhave the right...context\", he insists) who plays the piano in bars to\\nmake a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it\\nsuccinctly - \"Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing\\ntheir dreams\". The musical flows thematically from first love to\\nheartbreak and every other emotion between, with great music\\nthroughout.The most impressive thing about the film, for me, is just how daringly\\nit dances between the old-fashioned \"Singing\\' In The Rain\" style of\\nmusical, and a bolder, modern style. The song numbers are great (the\\nopening number received a round of applause in my viewing) and are an\\nundoubted homage to classic musicals - a thoughtful mixture of old\\nschool dance numbers you\\'d expect from a musical in the 50s, and\\nemotionally-wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts; there is one\\nparticular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real\\ngut-punch. Stylistically the film skirts this same line; the film again looks and\\nacts like a classic musical but frequently we see low-key reminders\\nthat this is modern day; actresses using their iPhones, a video being\\nseen on Youtube, etc to remind us that this is set in the present day.\\nIf we didn\\'t have these reminders, the visuals would almost have you\\nthinking that this is the 1950s. The cinematography is beautiful and\\noverall the film is visually stunning. There is also no doubt that it\\nis wonderfully directed, with the same masterful control of pace and\\ntension that we come to expect from Damien Chazelle thanks to Whiplash.Gosling in particular is absolutely terrific, with a typically sardonic\\nwit throughout. At the start of the film when his sister says she\\'s\\nworried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes, he responds\\n\"I wanna be on the ropes. I\\'m just letting life think it has me and\\nthen before you know it - BAM. It\\'s a classic rope-a-dope\". His\\ndelivery of these sorts of lines can\\'t be matched, and it\\'s easy to see\\nwhy the producers said in the post-film Q&A that he was the person they\\nwanted for the role in their wildest dreams. It\\'s a role made for him\\nwith tons more of the above kind of lines. But more than that, Gosling\\ncaptures a real emotional intensity at the film\\'s emotional breaking\\npoints, more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film\\nthat I mentioned earlier. He manages to convey such convincing emotion\\nwithout so much as a word.I\\'d feel bad if I didn\\'t also praise Emma Stone, who has probably never\\nbeen better. She has wonderful emotional range, from the ecstatic highs\\nof love to the tearful, painful lows. In terms of the Gosling/Stone films, this is by far the best. Their\\nundoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with\\nfreedom to explore said chemistry without restriction. The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an\\nunashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and\\ndance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone,\\nwonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh,\\nand it\\'s hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one\\nof the best films I\\'ve seen in a long while. I\\'m annoyed I\\'ll have to\\nwait so long to see it again, frankly.Will surely win multiple Oscars and other awards.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nLa La Land is a triumph on so many levels. It hooks you from the\\nbeginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart\\nfluttering in the club at the end. Damien Chazelle has proved himself\\nto be one of the most talented directors/screenwriters in film right\\nnow.The film gets you with its charm. It flows from the dialogue like\\npoetry. The chemistry between Stone and Gosling makes the film\\nlivelier. Stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with\\nin Hollywood and now Gosling has join the ranks after his stellar\\nperformance as the jazz pianist who\\'s main dream is watch jazz live on.\\nStone is a wanna be actress who can\\'t find her way. Together, they\\nthrive off each other\\'s love and support as they try to accomplish\\ntheir goals together. Each have a chance at their first Oscar gold.What else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs.\\nI found myself humming \"City of Stars\" all night long, already saving\\nthe soundtrack on every music platform I could. The music and dance\\nnumbers are a perfect blend of Gene Kelly musicals and more\\ncontemporary stuff like Chicago. The production design helps with this\\nwith bright, vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building\\nto Emma Stone\\'s dress. A charming film only works when all cylinders\\nclick. This one was clockwork.Like Whiplash, the editing is superb, timing well with the score,\\nmaking it very appealing to the eye. But the cinematography was mind\\nblowing. Able to capture those big production numbers with long swift\\ncuts made it very astonishing. Not a moment seemed overlooked or\\nunderdeveloped. Each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the\\nbiggest \"awe\" effect, or to provide strong symbolism. But the ending is what can really make or break a movie. This one makes\\nit 10x better. It goes away from the predictable musical ending while\\nwrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences\\' eyes to\\nthe entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your\\ndreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to\\nstrive for them, but life isn\\'t your own la la land. Everything does\\nnot end perfectly.When combining all these elements together, you get one of, if not the\\nbest film of the year. In a year where things became bitter, this\\nreally ends the year on a high note. Cheers to the dreamers, the men\\nand women behind the making of this musical classic.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAn observatory, a boulevard, a bridge, a downtown trolley, all make up\\nfilming locations of the new film \"La La Land\". These locations are\\niconic, yet remain unnamed throughout the film. The sum of these\\nlocations create the city of Los Angeles. Any meaningful production is\\na sum of its cast members and in the case of \"La La Land\" there is no\\ndifference. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) come together\\nto create a wonderful production, but a lesser known yet ever present\\ncast member is the city itself. Throughout the epic musical sequences,\\nthe city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic\\nstreet lights. Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the\\nsongs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia but the city itself takes center\\nstage with the vibrancy of a leading man. It lends its beauty to be\\ndanced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as\\nbeing the center of attention. Mia being a minor actress in Hollywood goes to casting calls where\\nthose auditioning look the same. This image of Hollywood conformity\\nlends itself to the character of Sebastian who has to change his\\nperformance identity much in the same way Mia has done in order to fit\\nin and make a living in the beast that is Hollywood. With this being\\nsaid the performances of Mia and Sebastian are one of a kind, lending\\nitself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love. The imagery\\nof the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept\\nof a soulmate, while the business aspects of Hollywood coupled with the\\nnecessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds. The film\\nrepresents a city, a city that often times is at odds with itself; a\\ncity that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique\\nand often overlooked aspects that create it. Ultimately \"La La Land\" is\\na story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be\\nhad in between. LA is marketed as the land of dreams, yet is often\\noverlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to\\nfruition. The film explores the idea of \"what if\", and tackles the idea of a\\nworking Hollywood versus a Hollywood where the idea of art is\\nparamount. \"La La Land\" focuses on the idea of money versus art, and\\nshows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on\\nthe monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art\\nthat drove them in the first place. The movie is very much paced in the\\nrealm of Hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with\\nall the fervor of a young person entering Hollywood for the first time,\\nyet as Mia and Sebastian learn the inter-workings of Hollywood the film\\nslows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to\\njuggle income and art. \"La La Land\" reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that\\nis so focused on relaunches and reboots. It\\'s refreshing to see a\\ntotally unique film, especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood\\nand Los Angeles in such an unconventional way. The singing, the dancing\\nand cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of\\nsomething larger than life. The long musical sequences often border on\\nthe surreal, taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers\\nin the clouds and in the stars. Yet at times the pacing of the film\\nseems to trail off to a point of being boring, this is quickly\\nremedied, but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing. Watching \"La La Land\" is like being awake during a wondrous dream,\\nthere is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia\\nand Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them.\\nAs he sits at his piano, Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love\\nsong, a powerful couple of lines that represent love, art and life.\\n\"City of Stars, are you shining just for me, City of Stars there so\\nmuch that I can see, Who knows is this the start of something wonderful\\nand new, Or one more dream that I cannot make true.\" With \"La La Land\"\\na dream has come true, and made its way onto the big screen.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nYou know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end,\\nand when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again\\nright there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film\\nfrom Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years\\nago.With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama\\nthat serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't\\nheard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in\\nthe coming months.Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film\\nstars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a\\nsmall time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but\\nit's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully\\ncrafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and\\ncinematography all playing their part in making this such an\\nunforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single\\nfault in this film.Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young\\nfilmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love\\nstory with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a\\nthrowback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers\\nwould have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively\\nsatisfying. The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los\\nAngeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work,\\nincluding some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance\\nnumbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike\\nmusical.Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead\\nperformances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably\\ntheir best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an\\nactor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved\\nearlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and\\nhe proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she\\nis dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts.\\nThe pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them\\nboth get the recognition they deserve come awards season.Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with\\nthe wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great\\nopening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten\\nthe film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's\\nfilms possess.I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land. I fell in love\\nwith it and I'm sure many more will do so too.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nWhen I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set\\nhigh. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer\\nwere enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it\\ncomes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not\\nin this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and\\nloving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA\\nand worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this\\nfilm's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone\\nwho's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love\\nwill also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self\\nproclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see,\\nbut La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this\\nfilm enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the\\nbuzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again\\nwhen it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nTelluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) led off its 2016 weekend film\\nfestival with La La Land, a captivating film that hearkens back to the\\ngolden age of Hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded in\\npresent-day Los Angeles life. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring a\\nstartling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have been\\nanother trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love. The\\nfilm impressed me on so many levels, for the quality of the direction\\nand cinematography, the seamless transition between musical\\nsong-and-dance numbers with a powerful narrative, the inventive\\nchoreography, the authenticity that Stone and Gosling brought to their\\nportrayal of their characters, and the amplification of the intensity\\nof their romance enacted through their singing and dancing. This film\\nis not-to-be-missed by anyone who loves the classic Ginger Rodgers-Fred\\nAstaire movies and who longs for a modern re- invention of this genre.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nA little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet? Damien\\nChazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient \"Whiplash\" \\x96 my\\ntop film of 2015 \\x96 with a sure-fire theatre-filler in \"La La Land\". The\\nold- fashioned musical extravaganza is back, and back with style!\"La La Land\" tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian (Ryan\\nGosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) who first meet in an LA traffic jam but\\nthen get thrown together by chance (LA is such a small place after\\nall!). Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms. Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a\\nhopeless attempt to break through in LA\\'s tough movie business. She\\nmakes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother\\'s lot. Meanwhile\\nSebastian is on a mission of his own: a talented musician, he is trying\\nto restore jazz to the main stage (something the film\\'s soundtrack will\\nundoubtedly help do!) by opening his own classic jazz bar. As both\\nstrive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us\\nthe classic \\'Hollywood ending\\'? The film is technically astonishing, with clever continuous shots of\\nthe \"Birdman\" variety and masterly cinematography (by Linus Sandgren of\\n\"Joy\" and \"American Hustle\"). The lighting team in particular is\\nsuperb: a case in point is Mia\\'s \\'in-Seine\\' (sic) song, with\\nbreathtaking fades of the background to darkness, a camera whizz-around\\nthe actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality. Loved\\nit. Overall, there are enough similar moments in the film to make\\ncinema-lovers like me gasp with delight.There\\'s a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely\\ndeliberate. Whilst there are obvious and non-apologetic throwbacks to\\nthe classic musicals of the 50\\'s like \"West Side Story\" and \"Singin\\' in\\nthe Rain\" and references to \"Casablanca\" and \"Rebel without a Cause\",\\nthere is also a 60\\'s vibe to the \\'girls getting ready\\' sequence; an\\n80\\'s A-ha cover thrown in at a pool party; and a Californian Prius\\nobsession that is surely more \\'noughties\\' than current. Most curiously,\\nwhile everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce\\nchanges to plans: the film is almost distancing itself from much of\\nmodern life.In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon. She is just\\nmagnetic on the screen: (tiny spoiler) the biggest plot hole in the\\nfilm is why on earth she wasn\\'t given the part for her first audition!\\nI was disappointed she didn\\'t win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for\\n\"Birdman\" in the \"87th Awards\" (she lost out to Patricia Arquette for\\n\"Boyhood\"): but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER. Ryan Gosling\\'s confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma: in\\nparticular, it is astonishing that Gosling could play \"only a few\\nchords\" on the piano before training for the film. A confidence boost\\nfor struggling piano learners everywhere. It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles.\\n(Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for \"Beauty and the Beast\":\\nsomething she might be kicking herself for!) Are they both the best\\nsingers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Debbie\\nReynolds (R.I.P.) or Cyd Charisse? No, undoubtedly not, but they have\\nan undeniable charm all of their own. (Perhaps we will see the ilk of\\nthe great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the\\nclassic musical. Can Hollywood take a hint?) The big question: now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden\\nGlobes for acting in the \"Comedy or Musical\" category, can they convert\\nthat to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play? I\\'d like\\nto think so. It\\'s also great to see proper movie-making taking place in the\\nHollywood studios again: during my recent visits to LA there seemed to\\nbe little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes\\nthere (although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of\\nthe filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot). Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music, and Justin\\nHurwitz (\"Whiplash\") has produced a gem with \\x96 notwithstanding the jazz\\nnumbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend \\x96 merely a\\nhandful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different\\nvariations throughout the film. The soundtrack is already in my Amazon\\nlibrary and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here\\nin the UK.Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original\\nscript. There is really very little I can fault the film on. In what\\nwas the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year \\x96 \"Hail\\nCaesar\" \\x96 there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance\\nnumber with Channing Tatum that I raved about (you can find it on\\nyoutube). If I was being picky, then this tantalizing snippet would be\\na better representation of the style and vim of the original genre \\x96 \\x96\\nwith the exception of the opening number, few of the song and dance\\nnumbers in \"La La Land\" quite get to that \"Broadway Melody\" level of\\nscale and energy. This, together with a few concerns about the pacing\\nin some places, led me to rate this as a 4.5 on first viewing.However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours, it\\'s got me well and\\ntruly under its spell! I normally emotionally resist films that arrive\\nwith excessive hype\\x85 but, in this case\\x85 I give in. 10/10.(For the graphical version of this review, visit\\nbob-the-movie-man.com).\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nA film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm, La La Land captivates\\nus from the very first scene. Visually, it is spectacular. All the\\nelements sing in harmony and coalesce together to form a beautiful\\nartwork. It was director Damien Chazelle ('Whiplash')'s dream for many\\nyears to get this film made, and what a passionate, special film he has\\ncreated. It is a pamper for your eyes and ears, and especially your\\nheart.But let's talk about that opening scene. A hundred dancers,\\nenthusiastically and joyously dancing and singing during a traffic jam\\non a freeway. Chazelle doesn't wait, he gives us the best from the very\\nstart. As the audience, we are immediately enchanted by a symphony of\\njoy and delightful music. I won't spoil the entire scene, but it is\\ndone with such incredible craft and skill, it will be remembered for a\\nlong time to come.On that freeway, we are introduced to our protagonists, Mia (Emma\\nStone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Both are struggling artists,\\ntrying to find their way in LA. Mia is an aspiring actress and\\nSebastian is a talented pianist, determined to revive and preserve\\ntraditional jazz music. Through a series of chance meetings, the two\\neventually fall for each other, and pursue their dreams, with one\\nanother by their side. Having worked in previous films together in\\nCrazy, Stupid Love and Gangster Squad, The chemistry between and Stone\\nand Gosling is undeniably instantaneous. The fiery intensity of their\\nconnection reminded me of the classic Hollywood couples we admired and\\nloved, like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.A city of dreams, there is no better place than LA to tell this story.\\nOn the surface, to those of us unfamiliar with the true essence and\\nidentity of the city, we can easily be mesmerised by its allure and its\\npotential for achieving our romanticised ideals. Chazelle wanted to\\nre-create the classic and nostalgic look of the city during the 1950s,\\nand he has successfully captured not just the aesthetic, but also the\\ntimeless feeling the city exudes, with a tinge of novelty. To Chazelle,\\nthe sound of LA is jazz. Justin Hurwitz's score is a blend of pure\\nextravagance and subtlety. With its jazz influences and undertones,\\neach note tells a story of its own. The trumpet gave the film its life\\nand energy, while the piano touched our hearts and soothed our soul. I was particularly awestruck at the daedal use of light and the\\ncamera-work in this film. Each shot must have been planned\\nmeticulously, and yet, they appear very natural. The dance sequences\\nare flawless, effortlessly blending in with the story itself. The\\nhilltop dance between Stone and Gosling, I can imagine just how much\\nblood, sweat and tears to get it perfect. As it is taken in one shot,\\none mistake meant that they would have to start again. The characters of Mia and Sebastian essential embody our hopes for\\nromance and our passions. We begin the journey with unbridled optimism\\nand as the story progresses, the harsh realities begin to emerge and\\nunveil themselves as we navigate through the challenges. In this\\nrespect, La La Land is essentially a realistic fairytale. In the first\\nhalf, we are overwhelmed by its elegance and beauty, and in the latter\\nhalf, we get opportunities to rest our eyes a little, and that is when\\nour hearts start to feel. Beneath the dazzling facade, the story waits\\nfor us to discover its hidden and layered meanings. Each frame of La La Land could be paused, and turned into an exquisite\\nphotograph. I am very glad for the success of Whiplash, otherwise this\\nfilm may not have been made the way it did. It is refreshing, and\\nalthough some might have called the idea outrageously crazy, this is\\nproof that being different can pay off \\x96 some also called Alejandro\\nInarritu's 'Birdman' idea insane. Perhaps this film would go down the\\nsame path come awards season, Oscar Best Picture? I think so.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\nDamien Chazelle dazzled with Whiplash (2014). Pace, acting, music,\\nstruggle and storytelling sure hit. He had toyed with the musical idea\\nwhen at Harvard with low budget and black & white Guy and Madeline on a\\nPark Bench (2009). He now delivers beyond any expectations.An Oscar-tying record of 14 nominations and rave reviews if just a\\nreflection of how good this is. More than all that this movie is a\\ncollection of transporting feelings: freedom, love, passion,\\ninfatuation, nostalgia. It explores dreams, hopes, fears, sacrifices\\nand reality. It has gorgeous and appropriate fantastic elements that\\nadd layers instead of detract from the story. Like Titanic (1997),\\nalthough a different beast all together, I cried, I laughed, I smiled\\nand was transported.Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone sell ever detail with their\\nextraordinary skills and dedication. They are often spell-binding. An\\non-screen chemistry and crafted from an assured writing and directing\\nvision that take us places movies have never taken us before. The best\\nMusical since Moulin Rouge! (2001) fifteen years ago with added cool\\nchoreography and gusto. Cold Fish (2010) was the last movie that blew my mind in such a\\ngraphic, edge of the seat, emotional, artistic, fantastic and physical\\nway. It also had a theme of planetarium and stars. I am so glad I saw\\nthis in theatres too and in IMAX with incredible image and sound. Talking about sound and music, Justin Hurwitz gets 3 Oscar nods for his\\nscore and two songs: quirky City of Stars and adorable Audition (The\\nFools Who Dream). Audition is a tour de force visual and visceral scene\\nfrom Stone and bittersweet song. Hurtitz should come home with one or\\nlikely two statuettes after been looked over in Whiplash (2014). The\\nJazz in both films is magical, but here there are other elements of\\nmusic (even to the choice of 80s pop music in the mix) and there is the\\nexplanation of jazz origins and essence that enhances the music as art\\nand is contrasted with John Legend radio-friendly record-selling\\nreality which books tours and pays bills.Sharp (C-sharp?) Chazelle deserves his two Oscars but has though\\ncompetition in both writing and directing including the return of\\nwriter/director Kenneth Lonergan after bar-raising You Can Count on Me\\n(2000) and Margaret (2011). Canadian Denis Villeneuve's Arrival (2016)\\nwhich is nominated for 8 Oscars and 9 BAFTAs is also a contender\\nalthough not my personal favourite film of his.The only assured Oscar win would be Tom Cross for Editing who won for\\nWhiplash (2014) and put every beautiful detail of Damien in a dizzying\\nand delicate succession, but I predict La La Land could sweep the\\nOscars. I guess it could get from 10-13 Oscars potentially beating the\\n11 wins tree-way tie of epic Ben-Hur (1959), Titanic (1997) and The\\nLord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). It won 7 out of 7\\nolden Globes and 1should win a fair share of its 11 BAFTA Awards\\nnominations this Sunday. Wishing it long life and success. Hard to beat\\nsomething that steals your breath and hard beat for 2 hours like this.Not just a movie experience, a revelation! Rejoice, live, love, sing\\nand dance...L.A. Hollywood - La La Land is the best Hollywood film of the decade or\\nmaybe the millennium...\\n\",\n",

Admittedly, I went into La La Land with\\nhigh expectations considering Damien Chazelle\\'s previous addition\\n\"Whiplash\" was one of the best films of 2014. Fortunately, La La Land\\ndidn\\'t disappoint in the slightest.The film focuses on two young people living in L.A. trying to fulfill\\ntheir dreams. Both the jazz pianist and actress meet and develop a\\ncharming relationship throughout the picture. First of all, La La Land is a musical; a perfectly made modern musical.\\nDuring a time where musicals have found appreciation only if they were\\nreleased before the 80s, La La Land recharges the genre that has been\\nso prominent to the magic of cinema. Everything about this film boasts\\nlove, life, passion, and fun. Pure and unapologetic movie magic that\\'s\\njust fun! Anyone who adores the art of filmmaking can recommend this to\\nanyone wondering \"Why are movies so great?\" This is why. No matter how\\nhard someone may try to dislike this movie, it\\'s difficult to deny the\\nwonder and pure movie magic this film has to offer.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone both create excellent chemistry on screen\\ntogether and present some of the best performances of their careers.\\nPerformances are quite excellent all across the board in fact which\\nbrings more life into the picture. On another note, Ryan Gosling\\'s work\\nin learning the piano for this role also shows remarkable talent\\nconsidering all the singing, dancing, and instrument playing is\\ncompletely genuine. For those expecting stage numbers matching Singing\\'\\nin the Rain or The Music Man might potentially be disappointed. This\\nisn\\'t a 50s musical - it\\'s a modern musical and correct expectations is\\nimportant. What\\'s important to know about La La Land is it\\'s a film specifically\\nfor film lovers; real genuine film lovers. Casual movie-goers will also\\nhave a grand time if they let themselves but maybe the hype has doomed\\nsome film goers experience. For anyone that\\'ll have a good time with\\nthis joyful experience, they\\'re in for a magnificent and dreamworld\\ndelight of movie magic that\\'s incredibly enjoyable and pieced together\\nquite perfectly.

       "  '\\nI vote \"excellent\" because I *judge* a movie only from the perspective\\nas a pathetically passive audience member whose only power is either to\\nstay or walk away. The movie is excellent because of its integrity. It\\ndoesn\\'t polish up the actors (like they did in earlier days), the movie\\ndoesn\\'t even bother to make the characters look \"cool\" or their abodes\\nlook like they were designed by your favorite interior designer. What\\nthey deal with every day (the songbook, \"is this gluten-free?\") is also\\nreal. If I would be living in LA I would go through exactly the same.\\nEven their romance feels real to me. The song and dance parts are of\\ncourse a manipulated hyper-reality, but they are real in the sense that\\nthey are not trying to dazzle me, the audience, with impossible moves\\nand taped-up smiles. With a little practice I can make those moves.\\nFailure to become an actress, selling out principles, experiences are\\nreal too. But neither falls back to cliché behavior like drug use and\\nviolence, which makes it also real, most people move on after they\\ntried \"the acting thing\" and become insurance saleswomen and not\\ndruggies. What\\'s also real is that you have to put yourself out there\\nto get noticed. What\\'s also real is that when you want your own club\\nyou have to have some earned money in the bank to realize *your* dream.\\nYou also have to have people around you who have your back and willing\\nto take that extra step; pick you up from Colorado to do an important\\naudition. It\\'s also real that success trumps people in Hollywood and\\nalthough the ending seems confusing, it\\'s beyond *real* that people in\\nthis hyper-capitalistic state we are in opt for money and status over\\nanother human being they deeply love. I think it\\'s cynical, but, the\\nreal clinchers is that if you or I would be in a similar position would\\nwe ignore the pain that is tearing apart our heart and pour ourselves\\ninto the next song or the next role?\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nAbsolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you like jazz, see\\nit. If you like romance, see it. If you like crying at the end of\\nmovies, see it. Just plain see it!

Yes, it's that good.It's funny too, because Jazz is one of my least favorite musical\\ngenres. However, this did not adversely affect my enjoyment of the film\\none bit.

I understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one\\nwill enjoy this film, as I myself have seen films in the past that were\\nwildly popular that I did not enjoy as much as the majority.

       "  \"\\nSimply dazzling! A beautifully produced motion picture musical that is\\nsure to delight audiences around the world. Ryan Gosling (Sebastian)\\nand Emma Stone (Mia) shine brightly in this self- reflexive modern\\nromantic film set on the backdrop of a classically composed movie\\nmusical echoing the song and dance numbers that Busby Berkeley brought\\nto the silver screen through Hollywood studio system powerhouse Warner\\nBros. Summit Entertainment's La La Land will have you laughing one\\nmoment and crying the next in this roller coaster of emotions. Every\\naspiring professional who has the dream of a substantive career as an\\nartist in the visual and performing arts--or just an artist in\\ngeneral--needs to watch this film. If you have ever been discouraged on\\nyour career path, or lack thereof, this film will aid in reigniting the\\nflame that fuels your dreams of writing, acting, playing, or whatever\\nyour passion happens to be. Whereas many films similar to this one\\nwould have shot it as a period OR modern piece, this film is nothing\\nshort of a masterpiece that harnesses the nostalgic appeal of the\\nclassic musical with the power of modern cinematic storytelling.Best part about Damien Chazelle's La La Land? The old-school movie\\nmusical feel from the moment the film opens. From set pieces to matte\\npaintings to the manner in which the cameras capture the story as the\\ndrama unfolds, this is both a modern story of romance and conflict and\\nclassic Hollywood musical. While some may find the cinematography,\\nlighting, and editing to be nothing remarkable, the fact of the matter\\nis that it required great skill and hundreds of hours of effort to\\ncapture the essence of an old Hollywood musical. To recreate a nearly\\nextinct film genre, is an outstanding achievement in cinematic\\nstorytelling and deserves all the 9s and 10s this film is receiving\\nfrom critics and fans alike. La La Land takes pages right out of the\\nbooks of Busby Berkeley (Footlight Parade) and Gene Kelly (Singin' in\\nthe Rain). Such a gorgeous combination of a classically structured and\\nchoreographed musical within a modern Hollywood. And the film could\\nhave easily rested its laurels on the technical and artistic\\nachievements alone, but the film also possesses an incredibly beautiful\\nlove story between two aspiring artists.In a modern studio system who appears all too often to be more\\nconcerned with franchise building, merchandising, theme park\\nintegration, and rebooting, this film is fresh, real, gritty, and\\nendearing. In a climate so predisposed to the Star Warses, Harry\\nPotters, Jurassic Parks, and Avengerses, this film brings with is a\\nbreath of fresh air that is nearly unmatched by any other film this\\nyear. While many are concerned with the lack of original stories coming\\nout of Hollywood, may this film be a testament that masterpieces can\\nstill make their way into cinemas nationwide and not simply the art\\nhouse theatre of the US' largest metro areas. Although film is a visual\\nmedium and should not rely upon the score or songs to carry the bulk of\\nthe film (i.e. Frozen), this film is very much about the music.\\nHowever, unlike films that integrate music in order to cover up poorly\\nstructured and developed writing, La La Land embraces the music as much\\na part of the story as the writing itself. In many ways, the film plays\\nout like music and flows like a musical score. The way the cameras\\nmoves, the editor cut, and the blocking of the characters is very much\\nlike a musical staff, like the way music is composed and performed. But\\nat the same time, the movie is not simply about the music but about the\\nrelationship between Mia and Sebastian; and furthermore, about their\\naspirations for the spotlight. Solid writing and a solid score.The casting of La La Land could not have been more brilliant! Both\\nStone and Gosling successfully bring about that 1940s feel in a modern\\nstory. That could be due to the successes of both in 1940s era films\\nprior. Stone in Magic in the Moonlight and Gosling in The Notebook.\\nWhile both can successfully carry a period piece on their own\\nrespectively, together they are a powerhouse couple like Fred Astaire\\nand Ginger Rogers. Their performances in this film were so incredibly\\nnatural, no real, and believable. At the same time, the actors are also\\nvery much contemporary--just like the film classic yet contemporary.\\nEven though the audience is well aware that Stone and Gosling are\\nanything but struggling artists, they play their respective parts so\\nconvincingly that you'd swear that we were actually watching a pair of\\nstruggling artists who do desperately want a substantive piece of that\\nHollywood pie. A great screenplay possesses protagonists that the\\naudience will love or love to hate, and the characters in La La Land\\nconnect so incredibly well with classic and contemporary audiences. Inspirational. This film will help to inspire those who have a talent\\nfor storytelling, music, or writing to continue to work hard and remain\\ndedicated to one's craft because that is the only way that a career can\\npay off. The moment you stop trying is the moment that the dream dies\\nalong with settling for less. Not that day-jobs aren't important.\\nCertainly the importance of a day job is shown in the film, but it's\\nimperative that the day job never cause an artist to sell out or give\\nup on the dream. Day jobs should fund imaginative dreams not eclipse\\nthem. There is much to love about this film; so much so that you will\\nlikely find yourself with a desire to watch it again. This IS\\ndefinitely my pick for Best Picture as we head into award season with\\nthe holidays coming to a close.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nFresh off of his smash hit, \"Whiplash,\" writer/director Damien Chazelle\\nhas returned with another original in the throwback\\nmusical-for-the-screen, \"La La Land.\" The film follows the two\\nprotagonists: Mia (Emma Stone), a barista who struggles to make it as\\nan actress in Hollywood, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist\\nwho was fired from his previous steady work and has struggled to move\\non both professionally and personally ever since.*Light spoilers to follow, with heavy spoilers later.*The plot follows Mia and Sebastian as they experience a series of\\nchance meetings: a traffic jam on the interstate, Mia finding him\\nplaying in a night club, a party Mia attends where Sebastian also\\nhappens to be playing, etc. \"It probably means something,\" Sebastian\\nremarks. \"Probably not,\" Mia replies. The two then sing a song about\\nhow there is no spark of romantic interest between them, despite the\\naudience and each other knowing that is false.The film is a dizzying array of technicolor and from the studio logos\\nto the final roll, you can tell you\\'re in a film that is meant as a\\nlove letter to the Golden Age of Hollywood. On a technical level, the\\ncraft is so tightly wound that aficionados will likely lose their grip\\non the narrative as they\\'re swept into the beautiful sights, sounds,\\ncamera-work, and stage blocking that can sometimes be distracting in\\ntheir virtuosity.Consider, for instance, the film\\'s opening shot. We pan from beautiful\\nblue clouds into a sea of unnamed singers, dancers, and, yes, even\\nmusicians and BMX bikers as they sing about their experience moving to\\nCalifornia hoping to \"make it.\" Some viewers may be so distracted by\\nthe level of technical skill on display in this opening scene that they\\nmay not realize that it doesn\\'t even establish the film\\'s plot, only\\nits mood and setting.In terms of casting, the film is pitch perfect. Stone & Gosling have\\nexcellent chemistry and in a film that relies heavily on visual\\nstorytelling, Chazelle struck gold landing two leads with expressive\\nfaces, emotive range, and who are both in the prime of their careers.*Heavy spoilers ahead*After a series of cliché setups, we arrive at the film\\'s core: the film\\nis a love story. But the love story is not simply between Mia and\\nSebastian; it is also a love story between Modern Cinema and the Golden\\nAge of Hollywood. The film sweeps you away on a current of whimsy, but\\nif you pause a moment to reflect on the course of the narrative you\\nwill find that the waters are not so deep after all. The film shows Mia\\nliving with three housemates, all who are vying for stardom as she is.\\nWhy should we care for her success any more than theirs? And for\\nSebastian, he presents himself as a loner and a hermit with\\nself-destructive tendencies: why should we sympathize with this\\ncharacter?The best reason that the film provides is that the two characters are\\nplayed by the films leads: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And be warned:\\nhow you answer this question will largely determine whether you like\\nthis movie.For my final take on this film, I would suggest that disliking based on\\nthe premise of inadequate justification for investment in the romance\\nplot is to miss the point. The point isn\\'t whether you care about Mia &\\nSebastian; the point is that Mia & Sebastian\\'s lives symbolize the\\ncinema of old coming into the Modern Age. One subplot involves\\nSebastian\\'s dream to open a night club where he picks the music.\\nCo-star John Legend asks the rhetorical question that gets to the heart\\nof the film: \"How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you\\'re such a\\ntraditionalist? You hold onto the past, but jazz is about the future.\"\\nIf you substitute \"cinema\" for jazz, I think you get the heart of the\\nfilm\\'s message.And here is where I will hold out several examples to illuminate my\\npoint on this subject: the film subverts expectations at many turns. As\\nI was leaving the theater, I noted that something negative follows\\nnearly every musical number (with very few exceptions). At the end of\\nthe opening number, they\\'re still in a traffic jam; after a\\nbreathtakingly staged dance at a party, Mia\\'s car is towed; after Mia\\nsings \"Audition\" near the film\\'s end, that signals the end of her\\nrelationship with Sebastian. The film closes with a journey five years into the future. Mia has\\nmarried another man and is raising a child, Sebastian has started his\\nnightclub. Unsurprisingly, a chance happening causes their paths to\\ncross yet again. Sebastian spots Mia in the crowd and plays a piece\\nthat (if not actually, then certainly in the film) is so beautiful that\\nit transports he and Mia into a fantasy world where all of the negative\\nthings that they\\'ve encountered together hadn\\'t existed. It\\'s\\nbeautiful, fantastic, and everything you\\'d expect in a storybook\\nending.But this isn\\'t a storybook ending. The film closes with Mia & Sebastian\\nexchanging knowing glances from opposite ends of the nightclub and Mia\\nleaving with her husband. Just like in the case of new jazz, this\\nmusical is a new tune played with a lot of familiar notes. \"La La Land\" seems like a breath of fresh air because of how\\nbeautifully it repackages and then subverts the old tunes we know and\\nlove. It is silly to speculate on what direction Chazelle\\'s career will\\ntake after this film, but his body of work thus far has demonstrated\\nthat it will be both beautiful and emotional.Thanks for reading.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\"La La Land\" is a dazzling cinematic explosion made up of life, love,\\nand music. It\\'s a magical musical ride through an unforgettable romance\\nthat is original and brilliant. After directing \"Whiplash\" and now\\nthis, it is obvious that director Damien Chazelle will live on to\\nbecome one of the greats. As a matter of fact, this might be even\\nbetter than \"Whiplash\" and it seems like it will certainly become a\\ncinematic classic over time. Although the film drips with a sense of homage, it still does not\\ncontain an ounce of cliché, which is a real relief! Reading the\\nsynopsis, it may seem like an average love story, but it manages to be\\nunpredictable. The depiction of the conflicts that arise during a\\nrelationship is reminiscent to Jean Vigo\\'s masterful classic\\n\"L\\'Atalante\", and this film deserves to be compared to such\\nmasterpieces, because it IS a masterpiece! It is not only a masterpiece\\nof cinema, but also of entertainment, music, humor, and drama. It is an\\nexperience that will likely be appreciated by all-everyone from high\\nbrow critics to young girls.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThere is nothing else that could be said about it apart from what I'm\\ngoing to. It is a movie of true, profound beauty, one that touches your\\nsoul and leaves you in silence and awe. And all of this is because it\\ndeals with something we all face at some point - what is right to\\nchoose in life, when our dreams also require great compromises? I truly\\nrecommend everyone to see 'La La Land', especially in a movie theatre,\\nto discover with their own eyes the great talent of Emma Stone and Ryan\\nGosling and the chemistry they share on the big screen. Surely, without\\na pair such as this one, the experience would have been much different\\n- it is a film that relies on their performances, which are executed\\nflawlessly from the first scene in which they appear to the very end;\\nall of their passions, desires and conflicts are full of life. You can\\nsee it in their eyes, dance moves and gestures with each other. The\\ncinematography is fantastic and the musical score has been part of my\\nplaylist ever since watching the movie for the first time (I couldn't\\nresist going more than once). The costume design is superb. I hope I\\ndidn't understate the beauty of this film. But in all seriousness, if\\nyou can, please go see 'La La Land'. It is a work of art.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nLa La Land is simply one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.\\nComing from someone whose favorite movie of all time is Black Swan, I\\ntend to like darker movies, but this more romantic movie blew most\\nmovies I've seen in my lifetime out of the water. At the surface, it's\\na simple boy-meets-girl love story, but the real magic lies in the\\nartistic direction. I came into this movie expecting a lot due to\\nChazelle's previous work of art, Whiplash, and I left the theater\\nabsolutely satisfied. The way the visual effects, music, and dance play\\nout in this movie make it the masterpiece that it truly is. Emma Stone\\nis the perfect amount of quirky for the lead female role, while Ryan\\nGosling is the perfect amount of dapper for the lead male role. The two\\nhave GREAT chemistry on-screen. The transition from musical moments to\\nserious ones to comedic ones is seamless. PLEASE go see this\\nmasterpiece. It is SO worth your money.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nI've seen a lot of films. Over 1,000 from all generations and all\\ngenres. I saw every great film to come out this year. Yet, nothing has\\nhooked me from beginning to end quite like La La Land. Damien\\nChazelle's last film - Whiplash - came quite close. But this is a\\nmasterpiece if I've ever seen one! It's magnificent! It's stylish, and\\ncool, and mind-numbingly beautiful! This is the film that you must see\\nthis year! It will make you laugh, cry, make your brain tingly. And it\\njust doesn't end. You'll have that movie high for at least a day after.\\nIt's everything you want; trust me. The score will stick with you for\\ndays. And you will find yourself listening to every song multiple times\\nover. I can't recommend this film enough. Go see it!\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nLa La Land is one of the greatest movies of 2016. It has career\\ndefining performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the highlight\\nbeing Stone. The Cinematography and Music are the other two highlights\\nboth being some of the best of the past decade. The movie is a great\\nhomage to old musicals like Signin' In The Rain and does this extremely\\nwell, opening with things like cinema scope and technicolor. In\\naddition, the dancing has some of the best choreography for dancing in\\na movie since movies like Signin' in The Rain. It should get nominated\\nfor best cinematography, best picture, best actress, best director,\\nbest production design, best actor, best original song and best\\noriginal score. 10/10 go see it now.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nDreams. LaLa Land is about dreams. The tag line is\"Here\\'s to the fool who dreams\"\\x85and its truly fitting. Emma Stone was lovely, charming and bright per\\nusual (fan of hers since Easy A), but I was most impressed with Ryan\\nGosling. I had no idea he was so talented! I was astonished by his\\ngrace and pure perfection as Sebastian; I mean, Ryan Gosling as a jazz\\nmusician was everything I never knew I needed. He sang, he danced, he\\nwas absolutely sublime. Like many others would say, Emma and Ryan have\\na chemistry that is undeniable and it\\'s hard not to watch them together\\non screen. They are captivating to watch, the energy flows through them\\nand into the audience and its really something special. John Legend was\\npretty excellent in a supporting role, initially it took me a second\\nseeing him in a different capacity but he was great! Acting isn\\'t his\\ntrade, but I liked seeing him even though I thought it was a bit brief.\\nHaving him sing in the film was a real treat for those who may not be\\nfamiliar with his music. His voice is like a fine wine; like honey in\\nyour mouth \\x96 thick, rich and sweet. His addition to the cast was smart\\nand really upped the ante musically, because John is just so supremely\\ntalented.As far as direction, Damien Chazelle was able do what so few directors\\ncan, and that is create magic on film. It\\'s really astonishing\\nconsidering the undertaking this film must\\'ve been for someone who\\'s\\nonly directed one other feature film. LaLa Land was directed as if by a\\nseasoned veteran, scenes were seamless and so precise, in some parts it\\nfelt like I was watching a live play. The film is the best kind of\\nfantasy, filled with love, joy, and life. You can\\'t help but walk away\\nthinking about your own dreams, feeling inspired to make those dreams a\\nreality. This film is a homage, a love song to a film genre that\\'s been\\nlong gone and sorely missed. It reminded me of old Hollywood glamour \\x96\\nthe sophistication and raw talent seemed to have the audience gripped\\nfrom start to finish. It was refreshing and yet envelops you like a\\nwarm blanket on a chill winter\\'s morning. It was effortless, clean and\\npure perfection.I did like that the film also had some clear undertones and commentary\\non Hollywood as well as personal growth. Without saying too much, I\\nthink that these points really rounded out the film making it very\\nrobust and multidimensional. The film was able to position itself as\\nsomewhat nostalgic while not being cliché or predictable. One of my\\nfavorite lyrics in the film is, \"madness is key to give us new colors\\nto see,\" and this is so true and poignant when it comes to the dreamer.\\nThe dreamer is mad, considered not to be practical \\x96 similarly Steve\\nJobs once said, \"the people who are crazy enough to think they can\\nchange the world are the ones who do.\" Sometimes madness and genius go\\nhand in hand, so don\\'t fear it, embrace it; embrace the mad chaotic\\nbeauty of having big dreams, hold tightly to them and remember that its\\nalways worth the fight to make it a reality.Bottom line: LaLa Land is a must see. You must experience the songs,\\nthe dancing, the joy and happiness this film brings you. It infuses you\\nwith hope and sends you back out into the world as a dreamer. I highly\\nsuggest this film be experienced by all, it is an incredible\\nachievement \\x96 the amout of applause at the end of the screening I saw\\nas deafening. This is a definite Oscar contender, no question about it.\\nGo see it! A++\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nGreat musicals make you feel like it\\'s a crime to put words to them.\\nAfter seeing La La Land, it was clear to me that the film was one of\\nthe best theater experiences I will ever have.First of all, I worship the beauty of La La Land. Emma Stone is\\nbrilliant. She somehow finds a way to be the most compelling woman in\\nthe room in every scene, but she doesn\\'t have to be the loudest. She\\nconveys the most power through her subtleties, and this is partly due\\nto her wonderful chemistry with Ryan Gosling. It\\'s her eyes that\\nmatter, when Gosling is simply talking, and she\\'s listening. Or at the\\nend when she walks away and they share one final glance between one\\nanother. The humanistic wonder expressed through Gosling and Stone\\'s eyes when\\nthey look at each other is enough to carry any picture. The music is a\\ngreat enhancer to their relationship, and especially their intense\\nmoments with one another. The rest of the music is beautiful, of\\ncourse. Especially notable is the opening sequence and \"Audition (The\\nFools who Dream)\". My personal favorite musical number is Mia and\\nSebastian\\'s theme. La La Land portrays extremely vital parts of human existence that are\\neasily forgotten about in daily life. Stone sings that \"a little bit of\\nmadness is key\", and ode to \"the ones who dream\". This particular song\\nmakes clear that vision, imagination, hope, endurance and love make the\\nimpossible a reality.The directing in La La Land is also a huge part of its success and\\nbeauty. There are very few films in the history of cinema that radiate\\nthe vibrancy that La La Land does. It\\'s colorful, full of people,\\nchanges in intensities of light and amazing set design. The film is so\\nexciting to look at.Finally, the screenplay is also very enlightening. Brutal realism, in\\nfilm and real life, complements the hazy dynamics of love, making the\\nemotion so much more powerful within the person. La La Land does\\njustice to this aspect of life; a love story so powerful as contained\\nin the film can\\'t last forever. The dynamic screenplay adds to the\\nfilm\\'s realism, which contributes to its overall power. Take one of the most beautiful emotional performances from an actress\\nin years, fuse it with legendary directing and unite it all together\\nwith a great screenplay, and you get La La Land. The film\\'s treatment\\nof love shared between two humans is that of a sacred bond. It makes so\\nclear the desires of humans for love, and the emotion\\'s ephemeral\\nbeauty.Musicals, if done right, succeed in expressing what cannot be expressed\\nby a narrative story and typical human words or interactions. This is\\nthe case in La La Land. The film bursts with song, fearlessly waving\\nits flag of magnificence for all the world to see.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI\\'ve got just one word for it, \"MAGICAL\". 2016 has given us some\\namazing movies and this one is definitely in the top 5.With the most beautiful soundtrack and two of the best actors, this\\nmovie just casts a spell on you.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry and I\\'ve loved their\\npairing since I\\'ve seen Crazy, Stupid, Love. The soundtrack is\\nenchanting, Justin Hurwitz delivers the most memorable tunes of the\\nyear, City of stars being my personal favourite. Mia and Sebastian\\'s\\ntheme and The fools who dream vocals by Emma Stone standout.After delivering Whiplash i certainly expected a lot out of Damien\\nChazelle and he doesn\\'t disappoint one bit.La La Land can be deemed as One of the greatest musical of this\\ngeneration and the most Romantic movie of 2016. Go and give into the\\nmagic, you won\\'t be disappointed.\\n',\n",
