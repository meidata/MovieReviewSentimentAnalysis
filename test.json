This is the first real piece of cinema that has come tothe theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and thefearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are braveenough to commit themselves to. If all these negative reviewers wouldjust look past the blood and the guts, they would find a trulymasterful piece of cinematic art that reflects both the expertise andeffort that went into making it. The storyline is a simple one, butit's told in a complex, interesting, and relatively unique way that isguaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the entire3 hour run time of the movie. Tarantino's direction is unparalleled asusual, and the performance of the entire cast combined with thewonderful cinematography and deeply engaging dialogue make for aremarkably fun time at the theater, if your willing to sit through alot of grisly violence and mean spirited subject matter. And althoughmany people are complaining about the heavy political undertones of thefilm's storyline, to me that is one of the main components of this filmthat stands out the most. The plot of this film serves not only as acompelling metaphor for the racial tension amongst the American peopleimmediately following the civil war, but actually manages to outlinethe visceral anger and unpredictability of the racial tension that theAmerican people are facing today within society. In a world hell benton purporting sensitivity and being politically correct, it's nice tosee a movie that's willing to raise a middle finger to that socialstigma so as to hold a mirror to the racial confrontations that arestill plaguing the American people to this very day. Obviously thisfilm is undoubtedly the most sick, twisted, and violent of Tarantino'sfilmography, and I'm willing to admit that it's not for everybody, butfor those of you willing to toughen up, keep your trigger happyinsecurities in check, and enjoy a mean, gritty, and badass film thatoffers no apologies for what it does best I highly recommend this film.And for those of you who are willing to let Tarantino's comments aboutthe police force get in the way of your enjoyment of this film, like Isaid; Disney is more than willing to take your hard earned money.", "categorie": "postive"}, {"usefulness": "523/932", "movie": "tt3460252", "title": "Go for it.

Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It maybe similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come oftenand in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantinodecides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine workthrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is alegend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make inhis lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I wouldstill watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest.

You are able to change yourown decisions, keep that in mind when viewing the character ChrisMannix(outstanding acting of Walton Goggins), who might be a sheriff ornot, we will never know.There really is a deeper meaning, but it won't be discovered by everyviewer. The decision to have an original soundtrack speaks volumesabout how Tarantino himself thought about this.Technically this is Tarantino's best work till now, from my point ofview, Kill Bill his second. But this is not the Tarantino most willexpect, this is no Kill Bill or Pulp or Basterds, it's a neatly filmedtheater stage play, an ensemble movie, which really defines the wordensemble. Soundtrack is fantastic, no not just that, it's near perfect.The movie is long, some people will find it boring and i understandthat as i said in the beginning you need to be interested, to be hookedperhaps by Tarantino's Style to look deeper. In my twenties I thinkthis movie would not have the same impact as it had now, perhaps Imatured with Tarantino. I like that about myself, I really do. Thankyou for entertaining me the way i want it to be, Mr Tarantino.The sad part about it is, that those who really should look behind theviolence(which is an art form), behind the offensive speech(which isjust a writer doing his job like he should) are not going to do it.

Kind of as they did in the old days ... though themovie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance inthe old days (playing in cinemas that is).Tarantino also seemingly making fun of people criticizing his scriptsor rather the use of the \"n-word\" by his characters. It seems like helistens and does care. With Madsen and Roth you have a couple ofReservoir Dogs thrown into the mix. Both terrific actors, but almosteveryone is being put to shame by Russel and Jackson. While Will Smithhad a great role in Concussion, the real Academy Awards miss was notnominating Samuel L. Jackson! Strangely enough Jennifer Jason Leigh didget a nomination. She's good, don't get me wrong, you just wonder, whyshe's the only one to get the nod from this movie.And that's because it's an overall amazing group effort. Some may feelthis moves too slowly, not enough is happening. That would either meanyou're not familiar with QTs work (he loves his dialog and we do too)or didn't read up on where this is taking place. Don't get it wrongthough: Because when it gets violent, it really goes all the way. Notfor the squeamish at all.Quentin made this feel very operatic and the larger than life settingsuits the movie and the characters in it. It's a mind game and it's awords game too.

You have a liberal bounty hunter, that once inthe company of other whites used the \"n\" word as if it was the blackbounty hunters name. How white women, the lowest, disgusting of whitewomen are more important and valuable than all others, especially thetwo black hardworking women that were murdered. History tells us thatdisgusting white women have destroyed the lives of many, especiallyblack people. The killing of the old man was brilliant, the message is:take your enemy down but use your head and not your anger or hate andhe was taken down and it was beautiful. The murder of the workers anddrivers was the most deceptive of actions, those killers came insmiling, laughing and making all relax in comfort, then they killedthem all with shock on their faces, the enemy is often never seencoming until it is too late. The movie allows the disgusting women tobe hung and I felt that she was hung for all the innocent, victimizedpeople that was hung and her hanging allowed us to know that she wasnot special or worthy of all the lives she had taken. I loved it and Ilove that Lincoln was dismissed and reduced to a lie. My favorite movieof the year.
